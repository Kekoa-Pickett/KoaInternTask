The resizing is wrong, probably because i have the size settings set to fixed.
For this, I might need to switch everything to minimumExpanding.

Python file works, opens everything. Just need to make it interactive with a bunch of functions

Maybe get rid of the completed tasks list and just move them to the end of the tasks list and cross out or fade them. 

Fix location of added tasks:
- Get taskGrid.children.sizeof and lower bound div by 3 = row and col = taskGrid.children.sizeof % 3.
- Just set every one to 0,0 and see if it will move the notes automatically. 
= As of now, just adds it in a list format with one under the other.



Layout of taskBox

self.taskGrid = container for all of the tasks to be added.
self.newTask = new task to be created using own class




in the main class, connect the add new task button to the addNewTask function that uses the "self.taskGrid" as a parameter. 
This function will call on the TaskBox class to create a QGroupBox element that will take the sizePolicy and sizePolicyDate for the init
requirements and will create an element.
This element will be added to the taskGrid in the addNewTask function and then returned. 

Can I make the addNewTask function part of the class? 

Did:
I completed the add task feature, adds everything in one column on the left side.
Got rid of the placeholder tasks and created task elements that are not checkable.
Condensed a lot of the code, interms of naming different things.

Todo: 
1. Figure out how to format the tasks inside of the widget and get the date correct.
2. Work on the delete buttons for each task created as well as the completed function.
3. Fix the taskTodoGroup box to update each time. 
*** I need to create a way to update the values each time something happens, whether it is the same event on the screen or if we switch it.
4. Work on the completed tasks list, probably just creating a widget that shows the time and a shortened task description.
5. Implement the clear completed tasks feature. 
6. Get over to GitHub, figure out how that works.

Work on the color scheme, change colors?
